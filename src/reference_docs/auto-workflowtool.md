# WorkflowTool

Takes a workflow and turns it into a Tool.

This workflow receives a fresh session. This means that it **is not**
aware of previous messages or the contributions made by other nodes
to the state.

After its execution, a Workflow returns an object with the results of
its output nodes.


## Full Specification
